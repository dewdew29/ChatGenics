# ChatGenics
A Chat Application created by me. 
Built using Php,HTML and CSS. For database, I have used MySQL for database.

To run this, you will need Xampp Server installed in your computer.
After installing, open it and start the "Apache" and "MySQL" server.
Now go to C:\xampp\htdocs\ and create a folder named "chatapp".
Inside the folder, paste all these files.

Now go to your browser and type this in the URL -> localhost/phpmyadmin
Click on "New", create a database named "chatappd" and click create.
Now here import the "chatappd.sql" file.

Now type this in the URL -> localhost/chatapp/index.php

There you Go!
